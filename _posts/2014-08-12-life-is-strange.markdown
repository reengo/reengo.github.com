Life is strange indeed! I came across this new game from Square Enix being developed recently and couldn't help but get curious. They call these games "[Episodic Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_video_games)" nowadays, which is quite similar to expansion packs of a retail version of a certain game. They will release episodes of this game frequently so I do hope the story will be compelling enough to spend time and money with.

From the twitter page, they mentioned it will have a butterfly effect so I'm guessing a lot of time travel aspects will make up the story.





Couldn't find a release date yet, but coming from Square Enix, this may be worth the wait.
