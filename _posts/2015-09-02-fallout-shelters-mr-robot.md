**R. Mika**, that busty and bouncy japanese wrestler joins in on the fight and she brings a ong a tag team partner, **Nadeshiko**

Honestly, I'm not that excited to see her back... she's annoying as hell! But better her than **El Fuerte!** :D

Nadeshiko also joins in for the assists for R. Mika. Could be a good variety since we've missed a lot of this since Street Fighter Alpha.

Though not a playable character (I could be wrong ). **Nadeshiko** looks fun to watch when using R.Mika, this also makes their story arc a whole lot interesting.
