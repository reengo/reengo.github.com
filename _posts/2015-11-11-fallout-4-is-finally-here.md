It's Here! It's finally Here!
---

You've got bombarded with posts on social media, memes all over the internet and all the hype in the gaming community is felt and heard, loudly. It's finally here, the release of Bethesda Softworks' Fallout 4. Say goodbye to social life, for a while if you are the ones lined up to get a copy on today's releae. expect posts to slowly decrease for a while as gamers get deeply immersed on this much awaited title.

No need to spill details here as you may already had it from memes, gameplay trailers and early in game footage. But I will try this out... when I get my PS4 this month :D
