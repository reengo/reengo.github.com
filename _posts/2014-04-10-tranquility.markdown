I've just revisited my old [deviant art account](http://laszio.deviantart.com/)... made me miss drawing so much that I remember this tranquil feeling when I finish a work. I feel I've contributed something good to society no matter how small it is, I figured I could have inspired someone in my own unique way.

Here's one of my creations nearly 10 years ago... surely, there had been major advancements in digital painting and I most definitely would want to try drawing again...
