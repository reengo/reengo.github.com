First Impressions
----

I didn't like Dhalsim that much but this Dhalsim makes do ... a little bit.

Visually Dhalsim looks really cool... with the white beard and all. The animations are really smooth and much more dynamic than the previous Street Fighter titles. But that cartoony look especially on when he does the Critical Arts are a bit off. Soooo cartoony I remember Naruto for a second.

Regarding that Critical Art, Dhalsim sips out a huge belly-full of air and throws a ball of fire like a hoop of Yoga Catastrophe and it looks really cool. Usage would be a bit more tricky now and it seems like Dhalsim could get a huge punish out on the low. not sure if the teleport could really make it safer since usually on Street Fighter IV, when Dhalsim does Ultra to Yoga Catastrophe, you can simply do a quick throw and escape the predicament. But lets see once we get him playable.

And did I mention the stance? looks way cooler now.

The Typical Indian Stereotype
----

We'll at least he looks more indian now with that legit turban and beard, not a racist remark. Back in the days I didn't really care if he's indian :D. Still malnourished and no eyeballs but that's okay, He's Dhalsim! he's been around for a long while and Street Fighter V will feel wierd without Dhalsim anyways. but I sure hope it could've been **Twelve** Better luck next Street Fighter maybe? :D

V-Trigger
----

V trigger looks quite useful as well, Dhalsim burns the ground with his V Trigger and as far as I have read, the area will deal extra damage that gradually regenerates overtime, that is you still have life.

Official Launch and Roster Update
----

Okay! so no more Twelve... Alex has also been demoted to a background character. at least for the time being. But Capcom teases yet another set of characters to join the roster after the launch which was also officially announced at the [http://www.parisgamesweek.com/en/](Sony Paris Game Week 2015). Street Fighter V is Due to release on PS4 on **February 16, 2016**.

I would guess (left to right):

- **Alex** - I mean look at the stance. :D obviously its Alex.
- **Guide** - Definitely guile.
- **Balrog** - I'm guessing its Balrog in training hood. Not sure with that necklace and come to think of it, He could be a new character as well, we wouldnt really know for now.
- **Ibuki** - Clearly, I can see Ibuki.
- **Juri** - It looks like a raised leg! It could be Juri, I mean... why not!?
- **Hagar** - They showed the eyes! Its Hagar! I mean, if not for a visible mustache you would agree with me instantly! :D

Okay, with that out of the way, Lets look at what the Roster looks like now:

So we have that as the official roster at the moment with the last new character left unannounced (Most likely be **Zen** as leaked a few months ago :D ). 

February 16... Can't wait...
