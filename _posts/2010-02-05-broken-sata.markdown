"reboot and select proper boot device
or insert boot media in selected boot device and select any key to continue"

...

Did countless tries of troubleshooting, disconnected and then reconnected cables, unplugged cards then put them back again... I literally dismantled CLIO to pieces and them put em back together in 1 piece like a jigsaw puzzle. After some tests I've concluded... its the Hard Disk Drive!

CLIO will live! yet again to pleasure me... er... HELP me with lots of stuff... not to mention night jobs! if you know what I mean! bweheheh...

Hopefully I could recover 500GB of lost files... sigh.
