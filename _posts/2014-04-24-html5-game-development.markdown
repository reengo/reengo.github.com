Just a few weeks later after the [Moving Forward with Mobile Web](http://rgb.reengo.com/moving-forward-with-mobile-web) talk we got invited again to speak at Bulacan State University. But this time my talk was about HTML5 Game Development. I couldn't think of anything good to discuss but the popular game Flappy Bird. The life cycle of the game was just the right topic to discuss. However, It was a great challenge to prepare a game in less than a week with all the things I've been doing recently but it paid off good.

I discussed how to create an HTML5 Game using the CreateJS Suite from Adobe. Coming from a former flash game developer it was a sound choice. Below is a Prezi presentation of what I discussed.



So we talked about Dong Nguyen and his Flappy Bird's fate, some statistics and finally a demo. On the spot, we created a similar game using HTML5 and Javascript (A tutorial on this will come its way soon so no preview just yet. :D). But unfortunately, time is not enough to add in a GameOver state.

Overall It was a great talk. though we haven't completely finished the game, we received good feedback from a very attentive audience. We also discussed about developing an app using HTML5 and Javascript thenÂ porting it on a mobile device using Phonegap but I left them with the curiosity of looking it up online and trying it for themselves :D
