Mr Handy Cracks a Joke and I Ain't Laughing
---

I did say on my [previous post]({{BASE_PATH}}/fallout-shelter-on-android-and-deathclaws) that there is a rumor that you can somehow get **Mr Handy** from the wasteland. It got me curious and I really wanted to get the guy without having to pay for it :D. so I sent out my best dwellers fully equipped and maxed out, all hyped and eager to survive just to scout for that darn robot. Suddenly, I see this from the logs:

I slowly read the logs, excited as a little boy opening presents on christmas eve, only to find out that it was just a joke. I thought somehow, the dweller who found him (Mr Rhenza Lockheart) would return to the vault with him... but at the end of the day, it was all just a big joke. 

Seems like there is no way to get Mr Handy for free... at least upon hours of scouring over the net for clues. 

I get it, its just $0.99! Why not simply buy one, you ask!? Well, it won't really be that rewarding wouldn't it?
